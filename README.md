# Lead-Qualification-Dashboard

**Chapter 1**: Introduction

1.1	Motivation

The motivation behind this project was to address the inefficiencies in the existing lead management process. The process was slow, manual and lacked a unified platform to track the leads. As a result, the incoming leads were not being effectively converted into closed deals, thereby decreasing the conversion rate and increasing the time taken to convert.

1.2	Objectives

•	To develop a unified platform to track leads
•	Provide actionable insights for lead management.
•	Track the incoming leads in a funnel analysis and monitor their journey.

1.3	Outline of the Report

This report is structured as follows:
•	Chapter 2 provides a review of the literature and market survey relevant to the technologies and methodologies used in this project.
•	Chapter 3 details the methodology, including the data preparation process, design and implementation of the dashboard.
•	Chapter 4 presents the results and discusses the improvements in performance
•	Chapter 5 concludes the report and outlines potential future work.




**Chapter 2**: Literature Review/Market Survey

In this chapter, the existing lead management process was studied. Additionally, the different technologies that could be used to handle data and build the dashboard were researched.

2.1 Summary
The review highlighted the importance of automated lead management and the role of a unified platform. 





**Chapter 3**: Methodology

3.1 Data Cleaning
The raw leads data was cleaned using Python on Jupyter Lab by following certain cleaning rules, like removing duplicate leads.

3.2 Data Joining
The cleaned leads data was joined with different data sources including regions and products data. 

3.3 Dashboard Wireframe Creation
Created the wireframe of the dashboard on Figma and finalised the views after multiple iterations with the team.
 
3.4 Dashboard Development
Developed the final dashboard on Tableau.



**Chapter 4**: Results and Discussions

The dashboard significantly improved the two key success metrics—increased conversion rates and decreased the time taken to convert into closed deals from leads.

4.1 Summary

The project met all the objectives and provided a robust, automated solution for lead management process. 




**Chapter 5**: Future Scope

Enhancement of the dashboard views with more data.
